Subject: Enquiry on Hong Kong Food Waste Recycling Data - GCAP 3226 Research Project

Dear Environmental Protection Department Team,

We are the student enrolled in the GCAP 3226 course at Hong Kong Baptist University. Our research topic is solid waste charging scheme with a focus on food waste. I would be grateful if you could provide the following data to support my study:

Food Waste Recycling Scheme & PRH FWSRBs
◦ Please clarify the core service targets (commercial/industrial entities or households) of the Food Waste Recycling Scheme and the basis for this classification (e.g., 2023-2024 recycling volume breakdown).

◦ Confirm the calculation methodology for the "PRH estate participation rate" (e.g., whether it measures estate coverage or household participation) and the core data used to measure the operational efficiency of Food Waste Smart Recycling Bins (FWSRBs), such as the 2024 daily average recycling volume.

Smart Food Waste Recycling Programme (Public Rental Housing)
◦ Please provide the recycling rate of the Smart Food Waste Recycling Programme (Public Rental Housing).

For your reference, relevant public documents include:

• Food Waste Recycling Schemes: https://www.wastereduction.gov.hk/zh-hk/waste-reduction-programme/food-waste-recycling-schemes

• FWSRBs in Public Residential Housing: https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202401/24/P2024012400339.htm?fontSize=1

The data will be used for academic research and policy analysis. I would prefer the data in Excel or CSV format (if available) and covering the period of 2023-2024. Could you please respond within 4 weeks? Feel free to email me if you need more details.

Thank you for your help!

Best regards, Chan Tsz Ying
