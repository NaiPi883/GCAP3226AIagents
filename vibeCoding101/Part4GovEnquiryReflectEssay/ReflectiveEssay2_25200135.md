# Reflective Essay 2

Introduction  
In this assignment I focused on Municipal Solid Waste Charging Scheme in Hong Kong and the process of drafting a formal enquiry, drawing on course materials and AI collaboration to shape my approach.

Main Body  
In assessing Hong Kong’s data transparency I found policy frameworks and annual reports readily available, while real‑time metrics and raw datasets often require formal requests. For example, departmental annual statistics were downloadable but granular sensor logs were not accessible without justification. Drafting the enquiry revealed challenges in translating broad research questions into precise, obtainable data points; I revised my DraftEnquiry to specify time ranges, formats (CSV), and intended use. The AI agent helped by providing structure, professional phrasing, and templates, which sped up iterations, but it lacked contextual judgment about which datasets were most likely to be released — something a customized tutor could anticipate. Through this process I developed skills in data negotiation, clear bureaucratic communication, and contingency planning.

Conclusion  
Access to government data would enable validation of survey results and stronger geographic comparisons. If requests are denied, I will expand primary data collection, use academic datasets, and benchmark internationally. I will apply these lessons to future data‑driven policy work.
